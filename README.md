## Installation

Add the following to your `Gemfile`
```ruby
gem 'solidus_wishlist', github: 'boomerdigital/solidus_wishlist', branch: 'master'
```

```

If you want to include the ability to email a friend your wishlist, add the following to your `Gemfile`

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

You need at least PhantomJS, see the [README for install instruction](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist#installing-phantomjs).

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_whishlist/factories'
```
